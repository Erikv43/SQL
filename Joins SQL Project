#This project uses sales, customer, employee and music data from multiple tables#
#Many of the tables are not directly connected so multiple JOINS are needed to complete the data and answer the questions#

#Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country#

#Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name#
