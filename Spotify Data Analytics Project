#For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle#
#Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into#

#Creating the table# 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table#

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL# 

#What are the 10 best songs to dance to?#
Select artist_name, track_name, danceability
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Order By danceability desc
Limit 10;

#Which artists have multiple songs over 90 popularity and what are those songs?#
Select artist_name, track_name, popularity
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Where popularity > 89
Order by artist_name, popularity desc;

Select artist_name, count(artist_name) as hits
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Where popularity > 89
Group by artist_name
Having hits > 1;

#Which 3 artists would you recommend if someone likes low energy music?#
Select artist_name, avg(energy)
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Group by artist_name
Order by avg(energy) asc
